# Solidity Smart Contracts

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Solidity smart contracts designed for use on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are intended for various purposes, including but not limited to token creation, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and non-fungible token (NFT) projects.

## Contract Descriptions

### ContractName.sol

- **Purpose**: Briefly describe what the contract does and its intended use case.
- **Key Features**: Highlight any unique features or capabilities of the contract.
- **Dependencies**: List any other contracts or libraries this contract depends on.

### AnotherContractName.sol

- Repeat the structure for each contract included in the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract compilation and deployment
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for a personal Ethereum blockchain for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   https://github.com/valleyofblackpanther/solidity-contract
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Compilation

Compile the smart contracts using Truffle or Hardhat:

For Truffle:
```sh
truffle compile
```

For Hardhat:
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deployment

Deploy your contracts to a local or live network:

For Truffle:
```sh
truffle migrate --network <network_name>
```

For Hardhat:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
```

## Testing

Run the tests written for your smart contracts:

For Truffle:
```sh
truffle test
```

For Hardhat:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```
